# BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in IT â€” Assignment Work

Hello! This is a repository to share [my](https://thomasr.me) assignment work completed while studying a BTEC Diploma in IT at Solihull College.
Any programming and development work relating to this course is located [in the GitHub org](https://github.com/tomatsolihull).

**This is my own work**. Please be very careful about copy-and-pasting content from here. Colleges and Universities take plagiarism very seriously.

These documents are simply provided as a showcase of my work; Information within them is not guaranteed to be accurate or up-to-date, and any views or opinions expressed are mine and mine alone.

Some work has not been included because it would take significant effort to collate, contains sensitive information, or contains PII of staff/students. Do get in touch if you'd like a redacted copy of anything missing.

Most of my first year work isn't the greatest, and I'm surprised a lot of it was up-to-snuff. My MS Word template wasn't great either. I'm a lot prouder of my second year work. Despite this, these 43 assignments across 18 units cover all 212 tasks required to achieve D\*D\*D\*. This is the highest grade possible, equivalent to 3 A\*s at A-Level. This has yet to be formally awarded, however.
